

    Sieve the flour 2-3 times. We need to make two cakes that is one vanilla cake and one chocolate cake. So we divide all wet ingredients into half

    For vanilla cake. Mix dry ingredients first. For that take a bowl add 1/2 cup flour, 1/2 cup sugar. Mix well.

    To this add 2 egg and whisk. Once it is mixed well add 1/4 cup oil and mix well.

    Repeat the same step for chocolate cake as well with the remaining ingredients.

    Now mix vinegar and baking soda and add it to vanilla cake batter. Again add the same mix to chocolate cake batter. This mix actually act as raising agent

    Take two cake pans grease it well and pour the two batter into two pan and put it in the oven that is already preheated for 10 min.i have put it in bake mode for 200 degree for about 20 min.
   

    Once cake is done allow it to cool.. mean while we make the frost and ganache.

    Ganache is easier to make. Double boil 100gm of cream on a stove and to that add the white choc.once melted and comes in pouring consistency. Keep them aside. Repeat the same step for choc ganache.

    Now the frosting. Beat the cream until it‚Äôs fluffy and add some icing sugar to it according to your sweet tooth

    Keep a small portion of frosting aside just to mix the chocolate in to it. So now we have white frost and chocolate frosting. Keep both these frosting in the fridge and take it outside only when we start layering the cake.
    

    Layering time... cut both cake into equal half. Layer it alternatively ie... first keep one vanila layer. Top it with vanila frost now put the chocolate cake and on top of it put choc frost. Repeat it when all layers are done.

    Cover the cake white white frosting and put this cake in the fridge for them to set.

    Once set pout the white chocolate ganache on to it evenly. And drizzle the chocolate ganache on it then with a tooth oil you can design it as you want. Done
